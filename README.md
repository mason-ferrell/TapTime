# TapTime

Collaborators: Jake Colleran and Mason Ferrell

This was written in React 18 using Django run on python3.

To run this program, you must first navigate to /Samples and run 'python3 -m http.server 18888' (if we were trying to permanently host our project, we would simply permanently host this site, but for the time being this will have to do). Then, in a new terminal, in the root directory, run 'source venv/bin/activate', and finally navigate to /TapTime and run 'python3 manage.py runserver'
